Geany4zig - Experimental fork of geany for use with ziglang
----------------------------------

See README_geany for the original readme regarding build dependencies etc.

This fork is intended as a testing ground ziglang support in geany.

For lightweight support (syntax highlighting) for zig in a regular geany release: 
copy "/data/filetypes/filetypes.ZigBasicSupport.conf" from this repository into "$/.config/geany/filedefs".

Progress so far:
- syntax highlighting for zig
- symbol list with nesting for structs
- clickable compiler messages, to e.g go to line in code where there was an error
- hotkeys to build/test/run
